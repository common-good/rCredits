rCredits Software
Notes for developers

    UPDATE PROCEDURE (for upgrading software on the production server new.rcredits.org)
		- Run all tests before upload. No upload if not 100% pass. 
		  Exceptions: 
		  . new feature failure, if new feature is disabled.
		  . admin.inc can normally be uploaded without testing
		  . temporary debugging statements can be added if they are first tested on ws.rcredits.org
		  . cut and paste bug fixes on prod server when they are in just one or two clumps of 6 lines or less AND the functions being patched have not otherwise changed (on the DEV system) since the last update
		- Find and delete all temporary debugging statements:
///       . Search for "debug(" and "die(". All such lines should begin with /// or (if keepers) /**/ 
            Sometime write a macro to do the finding. 
		  . Make sure debugMode in dwolla.php is FALSE.
		- Upload first to ws.rcredits.org, rebuild menus (and maybe reinstall) and make sure SOMETHING works
		- When updating data directly through phpMyAdmin or the PHP window or other admin tools, back up the database or relevant tables first.
		- Upload to new.rcredits.org, rebuild menus (and maybe reinstall) and make sure SOMETHING works.
		***

	MEMBERSHIP PROCEDURE:
		. wait for READY status (once all steps are done, including Dwolla account and bank connection REQUEST)
		. make sure the photo is adequate
		. mark the account as an rTrader (OK) (before printing card)
		. print card and welcome materials, mail to new member (welcome includes reminder to verify bank account)

**************************************************

A. Development environment
 - See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQU-PPown2TV02Xg9htxByzOhUopGH-areUrlZ94Te0/edit
   for Step by Step Development Environment Setup Instructions
 - Use Notepad++ for viewing and editing .feature files (makes it a LOT more pleasant).
   View/User-Defined Dialogue/Import gherkin-format-notepad++.xml from the Gherkin folder
   If you use Notepad++ for PHP, Go to Settings/Style Configurator/Language, select php, add the following list to User Ext.:
      inc module test class install steps
   Also go to Settings/Preferences/Tab Settings and set the tab size to 2, replace with spaces
 - TESTING:
   . offline (isDEV): The only place to run the feature tests (sign in as admin, click Handy, then Run Tests). Dwolla is active, but only the tester's dwolla account (DW_TESTER_ACCOUNT) will be used (and only for small amounts sent to Dwolla's "reflector" account). When Dwolla has a sandbox we will use it here.
   . staging server (!isDEV and !isPRODUCTION): copy production database to the staging server (for example ws.rcredits.org), then do something to see what will happen when it happens for real on the production server. Ideally, we should have (1) an API that allows a list of events to be automated and (2) a "what happened since xxx" report. Emails are disabled except to the organization and the tester. USD transactions are disabled completely (so no testing of real Dwolla transactions is possible here) -- when Dwolla has a real sandbox we will use it here.
   . production server (isPRODUCTION): keep an eye on results, but don't mess with it
 
B. Coding style and strategies:
  - isDEV (defined at the top of rcredits.inc) is TRUE only under Windows
  - Mostly follow generally-accepted coding practices (For example, all of the Eclipse's defaults.)
  - Exceptions: 
    . Indent two spaces instead of one tab.
    . A simple if-then can go all on one line.
    . A simple else can immediately follow the closing brace of the if part. For example: } else zot();
    . Simple, single-line functions can go all on one line, without a documentation header.
  - Use camelCase for all internal variables and function names.
  - Use lowercase-and-hyphens for filenames and URLs.
  - Use lowercase_and_underscores only where necessary to keep Drupal happy.
  - Keep the code as short as possible without losing clarity.
  - In particular, avoid redundant code patterns, by creating small, low-level functions.
  - Make the tools easy to use -- that is, allow variations in number and type of arguments if that is convenient for the caller.
  - Avoid high-level Drupal functions -- for example don't use Views, Fields, and complex modules. Eventually we expect to
    drop Drupal, so avoid unnecessary dependency and entanglement.

C. rCredits module structure
   There are at least three distinct interfaces to rCredits, all sharing business logic code in the main rcredits folder.
   Each interface (rWeb, rSmart, rSMS, and rCron) has its sub-module in its own folder, with its own features and tests. Actually rCron is not a Drupal module and rSmart and rSMS probably don't need to be either.
   Code that is unlikely ever to apply to more than one interface, should not go in the main rcredits folder and vice versa.
   
D. rCredits namespaces and how they are abbreviated in calling files. Functions that are called outside their named space should be preceded by these namespace identifiers even when called from within the named space. For example, write t\est() not est() even within rcredits-testing.inc.
   r\ rCredits: shared business logic code
         (r\Web) rCredits\Web
         (r\Smart) rCredits\Smart
         (r\SMS) rCredits\SMS
         (r\Cron) rCredits\Cron
   t\  rCredits\Testing
   u\  rCredits\Utilities: helper functions that are not clearly specific to rCredits
   be\ rCredits\Backend: business logic functions called directly by the interfaces
        Separation of r\ from be\ is incomplete and muddy. We might wanna just use r\ for these backend functions.
   db\ rCredits\DB: our lowest level database functions (dbLookup, etc.)
   \   Drupal functions are marked with a (technically superfluous) leading backslash
 
E. Database clues
   - Download table with latest zipcodes, counties, etc. at unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip-code-database/
   - get countries/states table from CiviCRM db.
   - All rCredits tables begin with "r_", except `offsite` and `users`.
   - Uid fields in every table are bigint (unlike standard Drupal)
   - users (we use this as a table of accounts, not of users, and added many new fields)
     . Common Good Communities (CGCs) and regional servers have uid < 0.
         OLD: -1 to -17576: regional servers (the numeric version plus one of the region's 3-letter qid, negated)
           the software can treat any or all servers as virtual independent servers, 
           for example when CT started using rCredits for real before they had their own server, the NEW server gave them all "NEC." qids rather than NEW.
         OLD: less than -500000: Common Good Communities (leaving room for all 4-character regions)
         1+0  to 3T: users in (not yet independent) region AAA (admin is technically in region AAA)
         1+3T to 6T: users in (not yet independent) region AAB etc.
		 -1-0: the AAA region
		 -1-1 to -3T: communities in the AAA region
		 -1-3T: the AAB region etc.
		 Normally we would have community records only for one region (but each community in the world would have its own ID).
     . Tests create users with uids starting at 1+xT + 17550 (ZZA, ZZB, etc.)
     . name is a lowercase, no-punctuation version of fullName, sometimes with a numeric suffix to disambiguate.
         Exceptions: 
           admin is admin
           Common Good Finance is cgf (second in the "NEW" region)
           For regions, name is (uppercase) the 3-char start of their qids, followed by "."
     . pass and mail should be called "password" and "email" but Drupal doesn't. So it's confusing. (just a heads-up)
	 . access: tracks last transaction or login date/time (just major access)
     . we don't currently use theme, timezone, signature, or signature format.
	 . picture: used as a temp field for calculating stats
     . data: We use this to store auxiliary account information in a serialized associative array:
	     - signupCo: assoc [company, companyPhone, employeeOk, isOwner, contractor] -- these are stored upon registration, if the company does not exist yet (otherwise the info goes in the relations table)
         - wants: bit collection of nonmember stores the member wants to buy from
		 - by: who invited the account creator
		 - calling: the account owner's life calling
         - newAccount: qid of new account when this account is closed by moving funds elsewhere
         - oneTimePass: assoc [pass, expires]
		 - legalName: the account's legal name (usually same as fullName)
         - website: the company's website
         - description: the company's description (html)
         - selling: choices for what the company sells (first line is the default)
         - coFlags: flag bits for company
         - stats: past month statistics for the account (updated daily)
         - verifyBy: UNUSED how to verify the phone number (Voice or SMS)
		 - stepsDone: assoc of steps done (TRUE) or remaining (FALSE) before account is "member" (see R_STEPS)
		 - achMin: minimum transfer from bank account or drawn-on account (draw for purchases may override)
		 - pinThreshold: minimum purchase amount before PIN is required (NYI)
		 - lastTx: [xid, other-me, amount, created] information about the account's most recent transaction
		 - tenure: number of months at current address (supplied by user)
		 - moves: number of moves over the past decade (gleaned from SSN history)
		 - mediaConx: how many 1st and 2nd-degree connections with the system adminstrator
     . description is html for the company's page (N/A for personal accounts)
     . community: the (negative) uid of the account's CGC. For anyone who is not in an established CGC, their community is the region (using the regional server's uid). For region and community records, community == uid
     . minimum: the user's preferred minimum balance. Request at least achMin more (and always a multiple of R_ACHMIN) automatically from bank if balance goes under by even one cent.
     . usdAccount is the USD account number, encrypted with R_WORD (which gets set in settings.php)
     . secure is an encrypted (with R_WORD) serialized assoc:
         type: Dwolla
         pin: the Dwolla PIN
         auth: the Dwolla OAUTH code
         cardCode: security code for QR code on rCard
         cardCode2: security code for QR codes on person's rCard as an agent for a company
         bankAccount: IBN (or fake IBN for US accounts created from routing number and account number)
		 usdPhone: phone used when creating Dwolla account
		 usdEmail: email used when creating Dwolla account
		 usdPin: Dwolla PIN
   - r_txs
     . xid: record id
     . payerTid: Transactions are identified to the user counting just their own transactions (1, 2, 3, ...), NOT as an xid.
     . payeeTid: ditto
     . payer: uid of the account being debited.
	 . payee: uid of the account being creditd. CANNOT BE A COMMUNITY (uid<0) until getStats() is revised.
     . amount: the transaction amount
     . data: non-essential and unusual essential information in a serialized associative array:
		   undoneBy: xid of the transaction that reversed this one (if it is reversed)
		   undoes: the transaction id of the undone transaction that this transaction reversed
		   bonus and rebate: the dollar amounts of any rewards associated with a payment
		   preapproved: (not in the table, just internally) transaction is preapproved by another server (a payment or an authorized business unilaterally charging a customer)
		   disputed: TRUE if the payer disputes the transaction (else not set)
		   force: 1/-1 if transaction was taken offline (-1 if the transaction reverses another transaction)
		   changes: array of important changes made to the record
   (more to come...)
   - r_usd: record of USD transactions, so that can be rolled back if not in this table
       ALSO a record of what deposits and withrawals (to/from the USD bank) have been made/completed
	   @todo: these two different uses should be separated if we continue to use Dwolla (not necessary if, as planned, we switch to doing our own EFTs to and from a single USD bank account)
   - offsite: protected personal identifying information from the NEW region
     . id: a random id that matches the type and length of the original data
     . data: the original data, encrypted, len=
         
F. Notes on some PHP functions and rCredits utilities - often-used or crucial
     compact/extract: typically we compact arguments to a function and the function extracts them
     ray: turns a delimited string into an array, increasing code readability, typability, and maintainability
     just: makes extract() simpler, self-documenting, and less prone to confusion
     tt: our version of Drupal's t() function, but with named messages and more convenient substitution
     EXPECT: a costly but easy-to-use constistency checker
     ret<X>: A collection of functions to return the argument when it passes a certain test.
     is<X>: A collection of functions to return TRUE when the argument passes a certain test, otherwise FALSE.
     r\acct(): interface to the acct object -- representing an account (including region), combined with the current agent for the account. Note that r\acct($uid) is very different from new r\acct($uid).
    
G. Special rCredits datatypes
  assoc: an associative array (not really special, but we call it "assoc" rather than "array" in the function headers)
   acct: an account (including the region), together with the agent currently representing that account

  zid: a signed id (non-zero) -- the meaning of a negative value varies, depending on usage (ie a qxid or quid)
 reid: a relation id
  uid: an account id
  xid: a transaction id

  qid: a mostly-alphabetic representation of a zid, eg "XXX.YYYY...", used externally for REST and SMS queries.
    XXX (3 letters) represents the region's uid, YYYY... (some number of letters) represents a record ID
    the separator can be a colon instead of period, giving YYYY... a different meaning
      There are also two accepted alternatives to a colon: .. OR =
    The region (XXX) can be omitted in SMS identifiers (eg "200 to .ABCDE for pie")
    For each region that exists, we have a user record with uid < 0, with name = the region name followed by a period (eg ABC.)
    (Communities within the region have negative uids descending from their region's uid, and do not need qids,
    but could have a qid with a hyphen, like AAA-AAB, if needed.)
  
 qxid: a qid (8 characters or more) representing an xid (currently used only in rSmart)
 quid: a qid (7 characters or more) representing a uid acting as its own agent (. separator) OR an reid (: separator)

  The first two characters of a qid are a code for the country or region of population 5.7 million+. They could be unused most of the time, when doing business locally. 

  The third and possibly fourth character specify a smaller region within that country or region. For example NEW is Western Massachusetts. Each of these smaller regions may (or may not) have its own server. Next comes a dot (period), followed by as many letters as needed (no fewer than 3) to identify the account. An agent acting on behalf of an account gets a similar code with an equals sign instead of a dot.

  Here are the top-level codes for US regions:

  States: AZ  CA  FL  GA  IL  IN  MD  MI  MO  NJ  NY  OH  PA  TN  TX  WI (16)

  Regions: 
  NE:	ME, NH, VT, MA, CT, RI (New England) (6)
  VR:	VA, WV (Virginias) (2)
  CL:	NC, SC (Carolinas) (2)
  NW:	WA, OR (Northwest) (2)
  RM:	MT, ID, NV, UT, WY, CO, NM (Rocky Mountains plus NM) (7)
  MW:	ND, SD, NE, KS, MN, IA (Midwest, west of the Mississippi River) (6)
  US:	DE, KY, AL, MS, LA, AR, OK, DC (southeast continental miscellany) (7+1)
  UA:	AK, HI + territories (PR, VI, AS, GU, MP, etc) (non-contiguous) (2+5+)

  Other countries or groups of countries will also have region codes, which will default (for now) to their 2-letter country code.

H. Notes on transaction record system:
  - "rewards" are defined as signup bonuses, tx rebates, tx bonuses, inflation adjustment, and fee reimbursement. Transfers, grants, loans, and fines are not rewards.
  - uids contain the region info, so no need for recording "foreign" info in the data field
    Specifically: when we on the AAA regional server receive a transaction request using a qid, the first 3 characters are the "region" -- they tell us what database to hit. For example, if AAA.AAAA pays ZZZ.AAAC, we record a payment from AAA.AAAA's uid (1)
  - We send the request to ZZZ's server and expect a confirmation 
    (if no confirmation, roll back the transaction and give an error message OR queue the request).

  - On the other side of things, when we receive a request from some other community for a transaction with one of our accounts -- for example if we are the "ZZZ" community, receiving a request from the "ABC" community, for ABC.AAAAA to pay ZZZ.BBBBB -- we record the transaction as our own and send confirmation to the ZZZ server.

  - Thus every inter-community transaction is stored in both communities. Both communities know their trade balance, which should be public through a RESTful query. Intra-community transactions should also be stored twice -- ideally in member's devices. Smartphones and desktop computers running an app should store all their own transactions. Encrypted backups of everything to the cloud too.

I. Cron ops
  - ACHs almost always take 3 days (5 if there is a weekend in there). sometimes an extra day.
  - 

J. Handling USD
  - General Strategy: Keep about half the total USD in the community account, trying to leave each active member account with an equal share of the other half, but no more than R_MAX_DAILY_EXCHANGE===1000 (so we can take it all away quickly, at need).
  - Cron homogenize: daily transfer up to $10us from each account that has too much to each account that has too little
  - Cron pool: daily transfer $10us to the community, from each member account with more than its share -- until community has its target proportion of the total USD in the system.
  - Before payment: if payer does not have enough rCredits, just transfer it as part rCredits (as much as the payer has), part USD (DONE!). Don't go into gyrations to do every transaction entirely in rCredits. Just issue enough rCredits that most transactions happen that way.
  - Before cashing out: if account does not have enough USD, get it from other members (DONE, but limit the account to one withdrawal per day, limited to the amount we can currently get in $10 chunks without hitting anyone twice).
  - Common Good Finance is not a "money transmitter" (and therefore exempt from FinCEN regulation as an MSB) because "The term “money transmitter” shall not include a person that only: (A) Provides the delivery, communication, or network access services used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services;"
  - Each rCredits region is not a "money transmitter" because "The term “money transmitter” shall not include a person that only: (B) Acts as a payment processor to facilitate the purchase of, or payment of a bill for, a good or service through a clearance and settlement system by agreement with the creditor or seller;"
  - FinCEN's $1,000 limit therefore does not apply to purchases, but it may apply to exchanges. FinCEN is only explicit about currencies of "other countries", but to be (somewhat) safe, we should not allow the regional server to exchange more than $1,000 of rCredits for USD (or vice versa) with any one member in one day. It will also help to have more than one community per server, since the server itself could not be seen as belonging to a single community.

K. Other thoughts:
  - Joining by dumb cellphone is for play only. Accounts and transactions created that way should get deleted after a week of inactivity.
  - Suppose I live in 413 (NEW), but my cell is 987 (NYC). Person B lives in 222 with cell 333. When I am traveling to AAA I pay person B with SMS, by calling the local rCredits number. The local server contacts NYC to process my side of the transactions, but gets redirected to NEW. Similarly for person B's side. So at most 5 servers are involved (three just redirecting). NEW.rcredits.org and other subdomains act similarly.
  - in dwolla.php: replace "if ($" with "if (@$" and "if (!$" with "if (!@$" (DONE)

To clear cache:   http://localhost/devcore/devel/cache/clear?destination=node
  (or https://new.rcredits.org/devel/cache/clear?destination=node)

To uninstall the rCredits modules manually (export first, since this DESTROYS ALL rCredits DATA except users):
  DELETE FROM system WHERE filename LIKE 'sites/all/modules/rcredits/%' OR name='rcredits';
  DELETE FROM block WHERE theme='rcredits';
  DELETE FROM menu_links WHERE menu_name='main-menu' OR (menu_name='user-menu' AND mlid>20) OR link_title='rCredits';
  DELETE FROM menu_router WHERE access_callback LIKE 'rCredits%' or page_callback LIKE 'rCredits%' OR path LIKE '%rcredits';
  DELETE FROM registry WHERE module IN ('rcredits','rweb','rsmart','rsms');
  DELETE FROM registry_file WHERE filename LIKE 'sites/all/modules/rcredits/%';
  DELETE FROM variable WHERE name LIKE 'rcredits%';
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS r_areas, r_boxes, r_candidates, r_industries, r_log, r_nonces, r_regions, r_relations, r_scores, r_txs;
  TRUNCATE cache;
  TRUNCATE cache_block;
  TRUNCATE cache_bootstrap;
  TRUNCATE cache_field;
  TRUNCATE cache_filter;
  TRUNCATE cache_form;
  TRUNCATE cache_menu;
  TRUNCATE cache_page;
  TRUNCATE cache_path;
  TRUNCATE cache_update;  
  TRUNCATE sessions;

To exit maintenance mode:
  UPDATE variable SET value='0' WHERE name = 'maintenance_mode'
  Then clear caches (see above)
